# SQL Project: Digital_Music_Store_Analysis
This project analyzes an online music store database to help understand and evaluate the store's business growth. Using SQL, we explore the music store data to answer key business questions.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to help the music store understand customer preferences, spending patterns, and popular genres. By conducting this analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights that can enhance the store’s offerings.

## Database and Tools
